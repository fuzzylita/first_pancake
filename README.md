This is my readme file. It tells you informative things about pancakes.

The first pancake is often reported to be of poorer quality, and users express less enjoyment from the first pancake than from later pancakes.

There are many competing hyptheses to explain this phenomenon.

It is most widely accepted that the driving force behind the quality discrepancies in the first, vs later pancakes is directly related to the incorrect initial temperature, which is often manually adjusted between the production of the first and of all subsequent pancakes.

The correct temperature (in the strict opinion of the author) is low-medium flame on a standard gas range. Cook should proceed until any bubbles surfacing on the uncooked side pop, but do not refill with the uncooked batter. Flipping the pancake immediately when this stage is reached should result in desired doneness on side 1.

Cooking side 2 on unchanged heat for approximately 3/4 of the initial time should result in a balanced cook.

Repeated experiments have demonstrated that the resulting pancake (while slower to complete) is the desired shade of golden brown, cooked through while remaining moist, and has developed a pleasant rise.
